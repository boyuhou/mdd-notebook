This is a repo for maximum drawdown implementation

## Task
You currently work in the team and you work with our researches to implement features to monitor our portfolio. You are given S&P ETF SPY close price data in a csv file. Assume we buy and hold the ETF at the beginning (2001-04-16) for 1 million USD. Could you please implement a function to calculate maximum drawdown.

The spec for maximum drawdown is defined here: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maximum-drawdown-mdd.asp

The researchers shared their result in SPY_annual_dd.csv. Please treat us as the researchers and use 10mins to implement the function. You are free to use Google / ChatGPT. Please show the function and validation and discuss your work with researchers.
